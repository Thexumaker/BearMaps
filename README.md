# BearMaps
Capable of performing most features you would expect of a mapping application as well as map dragging/zooming, map rasterization, and includes
an A* search algorithm to find the shortest path between two points.

# Data Structures Used
TrieSet for search autocompletion, KDTree for point manipulation, A* Algorithm for finding shortest path
